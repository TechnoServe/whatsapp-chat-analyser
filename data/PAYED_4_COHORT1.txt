12/21/20, 9:42 AM - Tns Purity: Hi Gladys. 
The personal expense is the money that you take from the shop for your personal use. 

If you fully depend on your shop, we encourage you to be paying 
yourself some salary (it can be daily, weekly or monthly). 


Then you’ll be using *your salary* to cater for your personal needs hence you  won’t have to take business money to cater for your personal needs.
12/21/20, 9:43 AM - +254 716 097172: Mmh okay thenx
