"What To Consider when writing a business plan. 1. Define your vision. 2. Set your goals and objectives. Clearly define short term goals (1-12 months), midterm goals (2-3 years) and long term goals. 3. Define your unique selling proposition. That is, how different are you from the crowd that makes you attractive to potential customers? How different is your product or service? 4. Know your market. How many similar busineses/competitors are there? What services and products do they offer? What are the current and future trends of the industry? 5. Know your customers. Know what your ideal customer wants. Understanding the motivation behind customers' action can make your business successful. Put yourself in their shoes & then think what would make them choose you each time. Write down the ideas and implement them. 6. Research the demand for your business.

"We are still on business performance review...... Today we will focus on where to start during review *ASSESS YOUR CORE ACTIVITIES* A good starting point for your review is to evaluate what you actually do - your core activities, the products that you make, or services that you provide. Ask yourself what makes them successful, how they could be improved and whether you could launch new or complementary products or services. *Key questions about your products or services* *It's useful to address these questions*: 1.

"*Good morning, today we will pick it up from where we left.* Review your business performance Once your business is established and running well, you may be inclined to let things continue to run as they are. However, it's actually time to plan again. After the crucial early stages, you should regularly review your progress, identify how you can make the most of the market position you've established and decide where to take your business next. You will need to revisit and update your business plan with your new strategy in mind and make sure you introduce the developments you've noted. This guide takes you through this essential process, detailing the stages you should go through to assess how well your business is performing, highlighting your strengths and areas that could be improved and suggesting the actions you need to take to implement the improvements that you've identified. Why it's vital to review the progress of your business Assess your core activities Assess your business efficiency Review your financial position Conduct a competitor analysis Conduct a customer and market analysis Use your review to redefine your business goals Models for your strategic analysis Breaking down your strategic review Why it's vital to review the progress of your business It's easy to focus only on the day-to-day running of your business, especially in the early stages. But once you're up and running, it can pay dividends to think about longer-term and more strategic planning. This is especially true as you take on more staff, create departments within the business, appoint managers or directors and become distanced from the everyday running of the business. Reviewing your progress will be particularly useful if you feel: uncertain about how well the business is performing unsure if you're getting the most out of the business or making the most of market opportunities your business plan may be out of date, e.g. you haven't updated it since you started trading your business is moving in a direction different to the one you had planned the business may be becoming unwieldy or unresponsive to market demands It is also useful if you have decided that your company is ready to move on to another level. Setting the direction A clear business strategy will help to answer any concerns and show practical ways forward. Questions you might want to ask include: What's my direction? To answer this you need to look at where you are now, where you want to go over the next three to five years and how you intend to get there. What are my markets - now and in the future? Which markets should I compete in, how will they change and what does the business need in order to be involved in these sectors? How do I gain market advantage? How can the business perform better than the competition in my chosen markets? What resources do I require to succeed? What skills, assets, finance, relationships, technical competence and facilities do I need to compete? Have these changed since I started? What business environment am I competing in? What external factors may affect the business' ability to compete? How am I measuring success? Remember, measures of performance may change as your business matures. It's doubtful whether you will be able to answer these questions on your own - involving your professional advisers, your fellow directors and your senior staff will all help to make your review more effective. Assess your core activities A good starting point for your review is to evaluate what you actually do - your core activities, the products that you make, or services that you provide. Ask yourself what makes them successful, how they could be improved and whether you could launch new or complementary products or services. Key questions about your products or services It's useful to address these questions: How effectively are you matching your goods and services to your customers' needs? If you're not quite sure what those needs are, you could carry out further market or customer analysis. See the page in this guide on how to conduct a customer and market analysis. Which of your products and services are succeeding? Which aren't performing as planned? Decide which products and services offer both a high percentage of sales and high profit margins.

Look for ""quick wins"" that give you the breathing space to make more fundamental improvements. Are you reviewing costs frequently? Are you keeping a close enough eye on your direct costs, your overheads and your assets? Are there different ways of doing things or new materials you could use that would lower your costs? Consider ways in which you can negotiate better deals with your suppliers. Answering these questions will give you the basis on which to improve performance and profitability. Assess your business efficiency Many new businesses work in a short-term, reactive way. This offers flexibility - but can cost time and money as you move from getting the business going to concentrating on growing and developing it. The best option is to balance your ability to respond rapidly with a clear overall strategy. This will help you decide whether the actions you take are appropriate or not.

Are staff motivated and satisfied? Professional skills Do you have the right management team in place for growth? Do you have the skills available that you need in areas such as human resources, sales and IT? Do your staff need new or improved skills or to be retrained? Review your financial position Businesses often fail because of poor financial management or a lack of planning. Often the business plan that was used to help raise finance is put on a shelf to gather dust. When it comes to your business' success, therefore, developing and implementing sound financial and management systems (or paying someone to do it for you) is vital. Updating your original business plan is a good place to start. When reviewing your finances, you might want to consider the following: Cash flow - this is the balance of all of the money flowing in and out of your business. Make sure that your forecast is regularly reviewed and updated. Working capital - have your requirements changed? If so, explain the reasons for any movement. Compare this to the industry norm. If necessary, take steps to source additional capital. Cost base - keep your costs under constant review. Make sure that your costs are covered in your sale price - but don't expect your customers to pay for any business inefficiencies. Borrowing - what is the position of any lines of credit or loans? Are there more appropriate or cheaper forms of finance you could use? Growth - do you have plans in place to adapt your financing to accommodate your business' changing needs and growth?",en,"*Good morning, today we will pick it up from where we left.* Review your business performance Once your business is established and running well, you may be inclined to let things continue to run as they are.

Do they know what is expected of them? Do you operate a training and development plan? Do you pay as well as the competition? Do you suffer from high staff turnover? Are staff motivated and satisfied? Professional skills Do you have the right management team in place for growth? Do you have the skills available that you need in areas such as human resources, sales and IT? Do your staff need new or improved skills or to be retrained? Review your financial position Businesses often fail because of poor financial management or a lack of planning. Often the business plan that was used to help raise finance is put on a shelf to gather dust. When it comes to your business' success, therefore, developing and implementing sound financial and management systems (or paying someone to do it for you) is vital. Updating your original business plan is a good place to start. When reviewing your finances, you might want to consider the following: Cash flow - this is the balance of all of the money flowing in and out of your business. Make sure that your forecast is regularly reviewed and updated. Working capital - have your requirements changed? If so, explain the reasons for any movement. Compare this to the industry norm. If necessary, take steps to source additional capital. Cost base - keep your costs under constant review. Make sure that your costs are covered in your sale price - but don't expect your customers to pay for any business inefficiencies. Borrowing - what is the position of any lines of credit or loans? Are there more appropriate or cheaper forms of finance you could use? Growth - do you have plans in place to adapt your financing to accommodate your business' changing needs and growth?"

"Habari ya jioni. Natumahi kila mtu amejibu Yale maswali. Hiyo 'link itaexpire by kesho 'midday'. Siku za usoni tukiwa na miradi mingine ya kusupport wanabiashara huwa pia tunaangalia active participation ya wanabiashara kwa miradi ya kitambo. Kwa mfano, kama nilivyowaeleza hapo awali, huu mradi ulipokuja, tulianza na wale walikuwa wameshiriki kikamilifu kwa miradi yetu. Hao ndio walipata mikopo wa kwanza. Katika siku zijazo, huenda tukaja na miradi bora zaidi ya kuinua wanabiashara. Lakini tutawezaje kujua wale ambao wanastahili zaidi kusaidiwa na hiyo miradi? 1. *Tutaangalia jinsi yule mtu alikuwa anashiriki kwa mafunzo.* Tunafanya hivi kwa kutumia technolojia inayotuwezesha kuona Nani walichangia hapa darasani. Na pia kupitia maswali au 'Surveys' tunazo watumia mjibu. 2. *UAMINIFU* . Huwa inasemekana aliye mwaminifu kwa madogo ndiye tu anaweza kuwa mwaminifu kwa makubwa. Hapa tunaangalia wanaolipa mikopo na kwa wakati unaofaa. Kwa hivyo ni muhimu sana kwako kuchangia kikamilifu darasani na kuwa mwaminifu kwa kulipa mikopo inavyostahili.",sw,"Good evening. I hope everyone has answered the questions. That's' Link ItExpire by tomorrow 'midday'. In the near future with other projects of mutual businesses are also looking at Active Participation of business projects. For example, as I mentioned earlier, this project came, we started and those who were actively involved with our projects. They were the first loans. In the future, we may have the best projects to lift businessmen. But how can we know those who deserve more helped by the projects? 1. * We will look at how the man was involved in training. * We do this using the technologies that enable us to see who contributed to the classroom. And also through questions or 'Surveys, we have users. 2. * Honesty *. It is said to be faithful to the small one can be faithful to great. Here we look at paying credit and at the right time. So it is very important to you to fully contribute to the class and be faithful to pay credit appropriate."

"Good morning everyone , hope mko salama na mnaendelea vizuri na biashara zenu. Leo tutaangazia kuhusu leseni ya biashara *Liseni ya Biashara* Liseni ya biashara ni document ambayo Inaonyesha kwamba ume register biashara yako na ukona ruhusa ya kiselikali ya kufanya biashara yako pale unapofanyia. Katika serikali ya County kuna liseni tofauti, kuna zile unazolipia *mara moja kwa mwaka* na kuna zile unazolipia *kila siku*. Hizi unalipa kwa mfano Ksh. 20 zile siku unazotumia facility za kanjo kama soko. Unapopanga kufungua biashara, unafaa kuwaza kuhusu kupata liseni. Why Do I Need a Business License? Licenses help ensure that businesses are safe for the public. Restaurants should be clean. Lawyers and doctors should be professional and accountable. New drugs should be safe and effective. You can sometimes tell when a restaurant is not sufficiently clean. The dishes may be dirty, or the staff may be careless. You cannot be certain of its safety, short of breezing into the kitchen and testing the cooler and the burners. Benefits of Registering your Business *1.Establishing Business Bank Accounts* _You need to provide proof that your business is a properly registered business with the state to open a business bank account._ *2.Getting Loans* _When you apply for small business loans, you're going to have to prove that you're actually a business._ *3.Taxes And Liability* _This establishes that the business is paying taxes_ *4.Reputation With Customers* _Establishing consumer trust highlights the importance of registering a business._ *5.Supplier Arrangements* _A registered business also makes you eligible to receive supplier discounts that you wouldn't normally receive as an unregistered operation._ Kulingana na regulations za County, last year serikali ilitupea Msamaha wa kulipa licenses (liseni). Challenges za kukosa kulipa liseni ni gani? Ama unapokosa kulipa kanjo unapata challenge zipi",sw,"Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are safe and keep well with your business. Today we will focus on business license * Lease of business * Lease of business is a document that shows that you have register your business and unauthorized Permissions to do your business where you do. In the County government is different, there are those you pay * once a year * and there are those you pay * daily *. These pay for example Ksh. 20 those days you use the Facility of Kanjo as a market. When you plan to open a business, you should think about getting lisen. WHY DO I NEED A BUSINESS LICENSE? LICENSES HELP ESURE THAT BUSINESS ARE SAFE FOR THE PUBLIC. RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE CLEAN. Lawyers and Doctors Should Be Professional and Accountable. New Drugs Should Be Safe and Effective. YOU CAN SOMETIMES TELL WHEN A RESTAURANT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAN. The Dishes May Be Dirty, or the Staff May Be Careless. You Cannot Be Certain Of Its Safety, Short of Breezing Into The Kitchen And Testing The Cooler And The Burners. BENFITS OF REGISTERING YOUR Business * 1.Establishing Business Bank Account * _you Need To Provide Proof That Your Business Is A PropERLY Registered Business With The State To Open a Business Bank Account._ * 2.Getting Loans * _When You Apply For Small Business Loans A, you're going to have to prove that you're actually a business. ._ * 5.Supplier arrangements * _A registered Business ALSO MAKES YOU ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SUPPLIER DISCOUSTS THAT YOU WOULDN'T NORMALY RECEIVE AS AN UNREGISTERED OPERATION._ According to the Regulations of County, Last Year the government led us forgiveness of Licenses (Liseni). What is the missing Challenges to pay? Either when you miss paying kanjo you find what challenge"

Change can be the launching of a new product that is new to the market or a process that does the same thing but in a more efficient and economical way. 3.) .Visionary and Leadership quality-To be successful, the entrepreneur should have a clear vision of his new venture. However, to turn the idea into reality, a lot of resources and employees are required. 4)Open-Minded--In a business, every circumstance can be an opportunity and used for the benefit of a company 5.)Flexible-- An entrepreneur should be flexible and open to change according to the situation. To be on the top, a businessperson should be equipped to embrace change in a product and service, as and when needed. 6.)Know your Product--A company owner should know the product offerings and also be aware of the latest trend in the market.

It provides an entry-level job, required for gaining experience and training for unskilled workers. . 2.)Innovation- It is the hub of innovation that provides new product ventures, market, technology and quality of goods, etc., and increase the standard of living of people. . 3.)Impact on Society and Community Development- A society becomes greater if the employment base is large and diversified. It brings about changes in society and promotes facilities like higher expenditure on education, better sanitation, fewer slums, a higher level of homeownership. Therefore, entrepreneurship assists the organisation towards a more stable and high quality of community life. . 4.)Increase Standard of Living- Entrepreneurship helps to improve the standard of living of a person by increasing the income. The standard of living means, increase in the consumption of various goods and services by a household for a particular period. . 5.)Supports research and development- New products and services need to be researched and tested before launching in the market. Therefore, an entrepreneur also dispenses finance for research and development with research institutions and universities. This promotes research, general construction, and development in the economy.",en,"Morning everyone, Today's lesson is about *IMPORTANCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP* . 1.)Creation of Employment- Entrepreneurship generates employment.

"Good morning everyone, hope mko salama. Today's lesson is on the difference between an ENTREPRENEUR and a BUSINESSMAN: Who is a Businessman? . A businessman is an individual who operates or starts a business with the same old business idea. The businessman chooses to do business that is high in demand or give him maximum profits in return. The firm faces stiff competition because many companies already exist in the market having the same business ideas. However, the risk factor is very less as the concept has been tried and tested by other existing companies, so the chance of failure is low. . Who is an Entrepreneur? . An entrepreneur is an individual who has an exclusive idea to initiate and establish a new venture and bring a change in the world. An entrepreneur is highly creative and innovative, takes a risk and endures the unpredictability of business. The business started by entrepreneurs with a new concept for the first time is known as Start-up. The entrepreneur is an integral part of the operation, who builds and deploys the other functions of the operations i.e. labour, land, and capital. Later in the future, the entrepreneur becomes a businessman.",en,"Good morning everyone, hope mko salama.

Identify & focus on the 20% activity that will generate 80% of income 4. 100,000 people can do what you do, but only YOU can do it the way YOU do it hence there is no competition. 5. Charge your worth - when you understand number 2, 3 and 4, you will not be afraid to charge what you‚Äôre worth. It‚Äôs impossible to enjoy what you do or happily serve clients when you‚Äôre broke or can‚Äôt pay your bills. 6. Focus on solving your clients problems.

"Good morning everyone, Today I want us to learn about credit control system/planning. WHAT IS CREDIT CONTROL?-- Credit Control is the system used by a business to make certain that it gives credit only to customers who are able to pay, and that customers pay on time. It is a critical part of a well-managed business that will help reduce bad debts and improve the cash flow in your business. It's not just about collecting cash from late paying customers, good credit control is based on building relationships with your customers and creating a rapport with them. ADVANTAGES OF GIVING CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS: 1.COMPETITIVE EDGE:-. Offering trade credit will give you a competitive edge over your business rivals. Customers would generally favour the chance of selling and obtaining payment from their customers before having to pay for the goods you have sold to them. You may also need to offer such an incentive just to stay competitive especially if your rivals are already doing the same. A way of being more competitive is to offer greater terms and a discount for early payment. 2.INCREASE IN SALES:-. An increase in sales may happen when you start selling on credit. Your customers are likely to buy from you as their cash flow is not disrupted and it is not necessary to pay upfront to competitors. 3.BETTER CUSTOMER LOYALTY:-. Offering credit to customers demonstrates trust. The fact you trust them to pay bills by the due dates encourages a loyal business relationship. It is likely that a loyal customer will choose you over another business when bidding for goods or services. 4.MANAGED RISK:-As your business grows so does the risk of bad debt and reduced cash flow. Managed credit control will alleviate these risks by setting payment terms, credit limits and prevent and detect bad creditors. 5.PEACE OF MIND:-With managed credit control in place you will have peace of mind that your business has reduced risk, increased cash flow, maximised profitability, reduced costs, happy employees , good credit ratings and happy customers returning time after time.",en,"Good morning everyone, Today I want us to learn about credit control system/planning.

"IMPORTANCE OF BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION: The importance of bussiness diversification in your investments is to minimize the risk of a bad event taking out your entire portfolio.

There's also the ""opportunity cost of not being diversified, If you're not diversified, you may miss out on growth opportunities in a different asset class that you are not exposed to."" When you're invested in the winning team, however, diversification can feel like a punishment. It's hard to keep money in a lagging ‚Äì or worse: a declining ‚Äì investment when your other investments are doing so much better. But it's important to remember that today's top performer may become tomorrow's fallen star. During a bull market, it can be easy to forget that the market delights in surprises, The best safeguard against market cycles, while still benefiting from the upside, is through committing to a well-diversified portfolio and long-term focus.

"*Risk Management Structures* Risk management structures are tailored to do more than just point out existing risks. A good risk management structure should also calculate the uncertainties and predict their influence on a business. Consequently, the result is a choice between accepting risks or rejecting them. Acceptance or rejection of risks is dependent on the tolerance levels that a business has already defined for itself. If a business sets up risk management as a disciplined and continuous process for the purpose of identifying and resolving risks, then the risk management structures can be used to support other risk mitigation systems. They include planning, organization, cost control, and budgeting. In such a case, the business will not usually experience many surprises, because the focus is on proactive risk management.",en,"*Risk Management Structures* Risk management structures are tailored to do more than just point out existing risks.

Why is business risk management important for your business?* *Importance of Risk Management* Risk management is an important process because it empowers a business with the necessary tools so that it can adequately identify and deal with potential risks. Once a risk has been identified, it is then easy to mitigate it. In addition, risk management provides a business with a basis upon which it can undertake sound decision-making. For a business, assessment and management of risks is the best way to prepare for eventualities that may come in the way of progress and growth. When a business evaluates its plan for handling potential threats and then develops structures to address them, it improves its odds of becoming a successful entity.

Why is business risk management important for your business?* *Importance of Risk Management* Risk management is an important process because it empowers a business with the necessary tools so that it can adequately identify and deal with potential risks. Once a risk has been identified, it is then easy to mitigate it. In addition, risk management provides a business with a basis upon which it can undertake sound decision-making. For a business, assessment and management of risks is the best way to prepare for eventualities that may come in the way of progress and growth. When a business evaluates its plan for handling potential threats and then develops structures to address them, it improves its odds of becoming a successful entity. In addition, progressive risk management ensures risks of a high priority are dealt with as aggressively as possible. Moreover, the management will have the necessary information that they can use to make informed decisions and ensure that the business remains profitable."
"*Q2. How do we respond to the various risks that face our businesses?* *Response to Risks* Response to risks usually takes one of the following forms: *Avoidance* : A business strives to eliminate a particular risk by getting rid of its cause. *Mitigation* : Decreasing the projected financial value associated with a risk by lowering the possibility of the occurrence of the risk. *Acceptance* : In some cases, a business may be forced to accept a risk. This option is possible if a business entity develops contingencies to mitigate the impact of the risk, should it occur. When creating contingencies, a business needs to engage in a problem-solving approach. The result is a well-detailed plan that can be executed as soon as the need arises. Such a plan will enable a business organization to handle barriers or blockage to its success because it can deal with risks as soon as they arise.",en,"*Q2.

"*SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION* We have learned what is a risk & preparing a risk management plan. *Risk management* is a process in which businesses identify, assess and treat risks that could potentially affect their business operations. *A risk* can be defined as an event or circumstance that has a negative effect on your business, for example, the risk of having equipment or money stolen as a result of poor security procedures. Types of risk vary from business to business. You must decide on how much risk you are prepared to take in your business. Some risks may be critical to your success; however, exposing your business to the wrong types of risk may be harmful. *The most common business risk categories are:* *strategic* ‚Äìdecisions concerning your business‚Äô objectives *compliance* ‚Äìthe need to comply with laws, regulations, standards and codes of practice *financial* ‚Äìfinancial transactions, systems and structure of your business *operational* ‚Äìyour operational and administrative procedures *environmental* ‚Äìexternal events that the business has little control over such unfavourable weather or economic conditions *reputational* ‚Äìthe character or goodwill of the business. *Others* include health and safety, project, equipment, security, technology, stakeholder management and service delivery. *Preparing a risk management plan* Your risk management plan should detail strategies for dealing with risks specific to your business. It‚Äôs important to allocate time and resources to preparing your plan to reduce the likelihood of an incident affecting your business. You can develop a risk management plan by following these steps: 1. Identify the risk 2. Assess the risk 3. Manage the risk 4. Monitor and review *1. Identify the risk* Undertake a review of your business to identify potential risks. Some useful techniques for identifying risks are: *Evaluate* each function in your business and identify anything that could have a negative impact on your business. *Review* your records such as safety incidents or complaints to identify previous issues. *Consider* any external risks that could impact on your business. *Brainstorm* with your staff. Ask yourself ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô: you lost power? your premises were damaged or not accessible? your suppliers went out of business? there was a natural disaster in your area? one of your key staff members resigned or was injured at work? your computer system was hacked? your business documents were destroyed? *2. Assess the risk* You can assess each identified risk by establishing: -the likelihood (frequency) of it occurring -the consequence (impact) if it occurred _TIP: The level of risk is calculated using this formula:_ Level of risk = likelihood x consequence To determine the likelihood and consequence of each risk it is useful to identify how each risk is currently controlled. Controls may include: *elimination *substitution *engineering controls *administrative controls *personal protective equipment. A risk analysis matrix can assist you to determine the level of risk. *3. Manage the risk* Managing risks involves developing cost effective options to deal with them including: -avoiding -reducing -transferring -accepting. _Avoid the risk_ - change your business process, equipment or material to achieve a similar outcome but with less risk. _Reduce the risk_ - if a risk can‚Äôt be avoided reduce its likelihood and consequence. This could include staff training, documenting procedures and policies, complying with legislation, maintaining equipment, practicing emergency procedures, keeping records safely secured and contingency planning. _Transfer the risk_ - transfer some or all of the risk to another party through contracting, insurance, partnerships or joint ventures. _Accept the risk_ ‚Äì this may be your only option. *4. Monitor and review* You should regularly monitor and review your risk management plan and ensure the control measures and insurance cover is adequate. Discuss your risk management plan with your insurer to check your coverage.",en,"*SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION* We have learned what is a risk & preparing a risk management plan. *Risk management* is a process in which businesses identify, assess and treat risks that could potentially affect their business operations. *A risk* can be defined as an event or circumstance that has a negative effect on your business, for example, the risk of having equipment or money stolen as a result of poor security procedures.

"Lets start by *Definitions:* Understand the meaning of registration & licensing of a business *Business registration:* *Business registration* is the process of obtaining legal authorization to conduct business within your chosen jurisdiction. It is a legal obligation and ensures that a business is operating under the lawful obligations of its control. *Licensing:* The process of giving or getting permission to have, produce, or use something that another person or company has created or owns. *A license* is granted as permission to do something or uses something. In some cases, licensing is granted after some kind of test, to make sure that the person receiving the license is capable of doing the activity. A business license does not usually require an examination of any kind. Licenses can be granted by a government agency, such as a license to do business in a particular location. *Further Explanations* Activities which usually require a license are driving or occupational licenses (these licenses require an exam), marriage, business, or fishing license (these licenses do not require an exam). Individuals in many professions are licensed. These licenses are granted only after a test of some kind, as with doctors and psychologists, for example. *Licenses* may also be sold by individuals or companies; for example, the owner of a trademark or copyright may give someone else a license to use that intellectual property in exchange for *compensation and possibly royalties*",en,"Lets start by *Definitions:* Understand the meaning of registration & licensing of a business *Business registration:* *Business registration* is the process of obtaining legal authorization to conduct business within your chosen jurisdiction.

Partnerships are very popular with lawyers, accountants, consultants etc where two or more partners come together to form, own and jointly manage the business.35 *3.

It protects you from personal liability* This is arguably the biggest reason why many people have to register their business.

This protects both you and your customers in case any incidents occur. *3. Privacy* If you obtain a license for your business, you are ensuring that your personal information remains private. This includes everything from your address to your finances as they will not be associated with the business and will almost guarantee you retain a level of personal privacy. *4.

This protects both you and your customers in case any incidents occur. *3. Privacy* If you obtain a license for your business, you are ensuring that your personal information remains private. This includes everything from your address to your finances as they will not be associated with the business and will almost guarantee you retain a level of personal privacy. *4. Trust* Customers will more readily trust a company this is licensed, even if your specific company isn‚Äôt required to obtain one. *5. Good for the economy* With so many new businesses appearing every day, ensuring your business is registered and licensed helps to formalize the economy. It ensures the businesses sector is thriving, as well as strong and protected. Small businesses can also only gain funding or protection by the law once they are registered and licensed"

"Today we will focus on Cash Flow What is cash flow? 1. The movement of cash in and out of a business. 2. Cash that helps to meet the day to day expenses of a business NOTE: Most small businesses deal mainly in cash. They sell their goods or services for cash and pay their expenses in cash. Because of this, successful entrepreneurs typically have good cash management practices. Why is proper cash flow management important to a business? 1. It ensures there is cash to pay for expenses when they arise including payment to farmers and suppliers. It helps the business stay out of debt. 2. It saves the business from unnecessary expenses, e.g., loan interest, late payment charges, etc. 3. It enables the business to take advantage of investment opportunities when they arise. NOTE: Managing cash flow for your business is similar to managing your personal income and expenses. You can create a Cash Flow Budget to help plan how your business will spend and save money over time. Just like your personal budget it should include both money in or Sales, and money out or Expenses. Cash Out. This includes anything your business spends money on, including: rent, transport fees, airtime, marketing costs, payments to staff etc. These are your on-going operational costs, as well as your cost of goods sold. You also want to include any repayments for start-up costs or any money you might be saving for future purchases or investments in this section. Cash In. This is any money that comes into your business. It could be from sales, gifts, loans, interest earned, rent earned etc. Cash Balance. This is the amount of cash your business has at the end of a set period. It can be daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly. It is constantly changing as you make sales and incur expenses. You always want your cash balance to be positive. ‚Ä¢ The opening cash balance is the amount of cash your business has on hand at the beginning of a period. ‚Ä¢ The closing cash balance is the amount of cash your business has at the end of a set period. It is calculated by taking the Total cash in minus total cash out. The closing balance of one period becomes the opening balance of the next period. Budget and Actual. The CASH FLOW BUDGET includes columns for both budgeted and actual amounts. ‚Ä¢ The budget column allows you to project your cash in and cash out in advance, helping to identify any cash flow concerns early. ‚Ä¢ The actual column is used to record what money actually went out or came in. Comparing actuals to budgets over time will help your business better manage its cash flow. Ideally, there shouldn‚Äôt be much difference between your budget and actuals.",en,"Today we will focus on Cash Flow What is cash flow? 1. The movement of cash in and out of a business. 2.

"_Tumalizie_ *Types of Business Communication* *What are types of business communication?* On the highest level, there are two types of communication in the workplace: *Internal* (among the employees) *External* (with customers, partners, niche influencers, other businesses, etc.) Both of these types are equally important for the well-being of a company and can also be further categorized into subtypes: 1. *Written communication* (e.g email) 2. *Visual communication/In-person communication* (also referred to as face-to-face communication) 3. *Virtual communication* (through video chats) Meetings (in-group communication) Phone communication *What are different types of business Communication to consider for use in your business operations on a daily basis?* There are a variety of different types of business communication. Today's business communicators are fortunate in that they have a wide range of communication tools available to communicate with both internal and external audiences. That's the good news. The somewhat less good news is that the more options available, the more challenging it can become to choose the right options for the right audiences. The key is to understand the audience and then choose a mix of tools to get message across effectively. *1. Face-to-Face Communication* Nothing beats face-to-face communication and technology will never replace it. Customers prefer getting information from their dealers and in one-on-one settings. *2. Print Media Communication* Print media is still a mainstay at many businesses and is widely used to distribute everything from advertisements to notices to newsletters etc. Print can be used effectively to share information with a wide range of people in multiple locations and allows the opportunity to include text, graphics and photography. The downside, though, involves costs and production time. *3. Electronic Media communication* Electronic media has taken the business world by storm, offering opportunities as well as challenges. Electronic media includes the broad range of tools from email, to intranets, to social media and everything in between. The benefits of electronic media include immediacy and ease of changing or updating information. But electronic media doesn't work well with all customers. However, It is not as effective in the health care environment, for instance, as many nurses and other staff working in clinical settings with patients do not have as ready access to electronic media as those working in administrative environments. *4. Broadcast Media Communication* Broadcast media, such as video and audio, represents older technology that can now be leveraged through new technology as images and sound can be conveyed online. Production devices such as video cameras and microphones have decreased in cost significantly over the past several years, making this technology readily available and easy to use.",en,"_Tumalizie_ *Types of Business Communication* *What are types of business communication?* On the highest level, there are two types of communication in the workplace: *Internal* (among the employees) *External* (with customers, partners, niche influencers, other businesses, etc.) Both of these types are equally important for the well-being of a company and can also be further categorized into subtypes: 1. *Written communication* (e.g email) 2. *Visual communication/In-person communication* (also referred to as face-to-face communication) 3. *Virtual communication* (through video chats) Meetings (in-group communication) Phone communication *What are different types of business Communication to consider for use in your business operations on a daily basis?* There are a variety of different types of business communication.
